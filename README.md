This is a mini project that just clones the look of the google homepage.

What have I learned? Wow...a lot!

First off, flexbox is amazing. I learned how to better utilize them in
a website. to get it laid out how I wanted. I got the website almost there
without them but...I scrapped the whole thing and did it over with flex after
growing a little frustrated with positioning of my elements.

I learned how to better do fun things with different elements like hiding
their borders, or the highlight that goes around the input element. There is
so many neat little things you can do to style a website.

Looking forward to learning and digging in more. :)
